- CRUD operations: Inserting, updating, and deleting data from the database.
- Joins: Used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column.
- CTEs: Common Table Expressions were used to create temporary result sets for better readability and ease of use.
- Stored Procedures: Used to encapsulate a series of SQL statements into a single procedure, which was called multiple times in the project.
- Window functions: Used to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row.

## Requirements
- SQL for data extraction and manipulation.
- Data Analysis skills for understanding and interpreting data.
